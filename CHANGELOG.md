### Migration Guide: `mishagp/ocrmypdf` â†’ `mishahawthorn/ocrmypdf`

The package name has been updated from `mishagp/ocrmypdf` to `mishahawthorn/ocrmypdf` to reflect an updated GitHub username.

#### For Users

##### Step 1: Update your `composer.json`

Replace the old package name with the new one in your project's `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "mishahawthorn/ocrmypdf": "^1.0"
  }
}

```
##### Step 2: Update your dependencies

Run the following command to update your dependencies:

```shell
composer update mishahawthorn/ocrmypdf

```
Alternatively, you can remove the old package and require the new one:

```shell
composer remove mishagp/ocrmypdf
composer require mishahawthorn/ocrmypdf

```
##### Step 3: Update namespace imports (if applicable)

If you were using the old package with a `mishagp` namespace, update your imports to use `mishahawthorn`:

```php
// Old
use mishagp\OCRmyPDF\OCRmyPDF;

// New
use mishahawthorn\OCRmyPDF\OCRmyPDF;

```
**Note:** If the namespace was already `mishahawthorn` in previous versions, no code changes are required.

##### Step 4: Clear caches

Clear your Composer cache to ensure you're pulling from the correct repository:

```shell
composer clear-cache

```
#### Compatibility

This is a **non-breaking change** if the namespace was already set to `mishahawthorn`. Only the package name has changed; all functionality remains the same.

#### Support
